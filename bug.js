```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality, but it might not render correctly if the `to` and `from` colors are not properly specified or if there is an issue with the browser's support for the gradient syntax.
